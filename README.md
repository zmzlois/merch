```

These targets are either [inferred automatically](https://nx.dev/concepts/inferred-tasks?utm_source=nx_project&utm_medium=readme&utm_campaign=nx_projects) or defined in the `project.json` or `package.json` files.

## Keep TypeScript project references up to date

Nx automatically updates TypeScript [project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) in `tsconfig.json` files to ensure they remain accurate based on your project dependencies (`import` or `require` statements). This sync is automatically done when running tasks such as `build` or `typecheck`, which require updated references to function correctly.

To manually trigger the process to sync the project graph dependencies information to the TypeScript project references, run the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync
```

You can enforce that the TypeScript project references are always in the correct state when running in CI by adding a step to your CI job configuration that runs the following command:

```sh
npx nx sync:check
```
